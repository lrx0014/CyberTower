# Security Basics for Travelers

## Watch the Doors

- Check a door before you rush through it.
- Locked doors usually require a matching key or event.
- Some doors are tied to puzzling mechanisms hidden nearby.

## Inspect Items

- Keys, artifacts, and notes can appear on the floor or inside chests.
- Walk over an item to collect it.
- The inventory panel shows what you are carrying.

## Listen to Mentors

Dialogue can unlock new journal entries or reveal secrets. Revisit the Traveler Journal whenever a mentor shares something important.

Stay alert. The tower rewards players who observe, experiment, and document their findings.
