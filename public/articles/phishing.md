## ✅ What Is Phishing?

**Phishing** is a cyberattack where criminals pretend to be trustworthy entities to trick you into:

* Revealing personal information
* Sharing login credentials
* Clicking malicious links
* Downloading dangerous attachments
* Sending money

> If you take the bait → they steal your treasure (data, money, identity)

---

## 🎭 What Phishing Looks Like

Phishing commonly appears in:

* Emails
* SMS (“smishing”)
* Social media messages
* Fake websites
* Phone calls (“vishing”)

Attackers disguise themselves as:

* Banks
* Government agencies
* Tech support
* Delivery companies
* Your friends (!)

---

## 🔥 Why Phishing Works

Because it targets **human psychology**, often by:

* Fear (“Account will be locked!”)
* Urgency (“Act NOW!”)
* Greed (“Free gift!”)
* Trust (“I’m your boss, send report!”)

Phishing doesn’t break computers —
it breaks **people**.

## 🔍 Common Signs of Phishing

### 1) Suspicious Links

Look closely — attackers create URLs that look similar to real ones:

* `paypaI.com` (capital i)
* `bank-secure-login.net`

✅ Tip: Hover over links to inspect real destination.

---

### 2) Strange Sender

The sender address may look similar, but not the same:

* `support@amaz0n-help.ru`
* `help@paypa1.com`

⚠️ Real organizations rarely contact you from random domains.

---

### 3) Unexpected Attachments

Malicious files might contain:

* Malware
* Ransomware
* Spyware

If you weren’t expecting a file → do not open it!

---

### 4) Urgent or Threatening Tone

Examples:

> “Your account will be deleted in 2 hours!”

Attackers try to make you panic so you won’t think clearly.

---

### 5) Too Good To Be True

Examples:

> “You won 1,000,000 coins — just click here!”

If it feels suspiciously generous → it’s a trap.

---

### 6) Requests for Sensitive Data

Legitimate groups will **not** ask for:

* Password
* Credit card details
* Social security number
* Bank PIN

If they ask → run away!

## 💀 How Phishing Attacks Work

1. Hacker sends lure (email, message, link)
2. User clicks → goes to fake page
3. User enters info
4. Hacker steals info

OR
User downloads attachment → malware infects computer
→ hacker takes control
